# Hw-11

This week I finished and turned in hw-8. I also just finished hw-11. My design was to create a class that would create 40 bombs and when the hit the ground they would explode. I did get some help from Michael while at his office hrs. I had most of the code already set up. But the first thing I couldn't get to work was displaying the bombs and as Michael pointed out to me, I had a typo. Then affter that he showed me a simpler way to create the explosion. Initially, I wanted to make a comic book type exlosion with the yellow star looking thing that says "BOOM!" but his idea was just to make the ball size expand and turn white. After doing that he showed me that instead of deleting the first bomb in the array, it would be better to delete the last bomb in the array. This way there are less complications with letting all the bombs explode. I'm not going to lie, I'm still a little confused with the logic behind that little bit of code, but I'll probably ask him about it later.

I do, however, feel confident in setting up and creating a class. So hopefully I will do at least that part with ease when doing hw-12 and the final project. Also this week, I've been thinking about what my Final Project proposal should be. My inital thoughts go to a carnival game when you throw darts at a baloon and try to pop them. Not sure if I will stick with that idea but I have till tomorrow to come up with my final thoughts about what I should do.
