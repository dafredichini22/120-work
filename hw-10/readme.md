# Hw-10

For this week, I've been working on hw-8 and hw-10. I couldn't figure out how to do one last thing with hw-8 and so instead of waiting around to get help on it, I moved onto hw-10.
For my sketch, I did something a little simple but it does fullfill the requirements that were given for hw-10. I did use at least 2 functions other than draw and setup and I did use at least 1 array. My sketch was making a pizza. Though it might be the most interesting thing to look at, it still works. I was going to try and make it do something when you hold down the mouse, but I couldn't figure it out. I was either going to make the colors of the pizza turn more brown, as if it were being cooked or make a slice disapear for each time you click it. But both of these would have taken me a lot more time to figure out and I' mrunning out of time.

I did post a problem I had with hw-8 on github. Haven't been able to fix it though. But hopefully after I meet with Micheal, I'll have it figure out.

One problem for this assignment that I couldn't directly figure out was how to take values from an array and assign them to the x-coordinates of an ellipse while also taking values from another array and assigning them to the y-coordinates of that same ellipse while using a for loop withouot having just colums of the ellipses. I figured a way around that, but I couldn't figure out the oringal problem.
