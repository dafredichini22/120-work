# Final Project

For my final project, I created a carnival dart throwing game. The goal of the game is to hit 10 balloons with 10 darts. If you are successful, then you get a prize. If not, you lose. The hardest part of this for me was figuring out how to align all the balloons in rows. When I first tried coding that, it would just give me one balloon. After meeting Michael in his office hrs, I figured out that I needed to move my if statement into the setup, otherwise all the balloons would just get placed at the initial position.

Going to Michael's office hrs was a huge help. He not only helped me with little things such as figuring out why I could click near the balloon and it would pop (the answer was because I was checking if the dart was within the diameter of the balloon instead of the radius) but he also inspired me to add a little more. He said I should put some more animation into it. So the latest things I added were movement to the balloons and a button for hard mode. Initially, the balloons stay in position, but after two free shots are stagnant balloons, they start moving and bounce around within the frame of the booth. The hard mode button makes all the balloons move a lot fast. So instead of moving at a random speed between 1 and 3, they now move at a random speed between 1 and 10. Definitely a lot harder.

Overall, I think I did a good job on this project. First of all, it works! Secondly, it incorporates a lot of past lessons such as objects, arrays, buttons, loops, functions and more. Compared to some other project examples, I kind of see my project as sort of simple, but then again, this project is supposed to reflect your abilities and do something you've never done before. So I definitely think this project was hard enough for my skill level. I probably could have added a little more if I had more time but that's always going to be the case.

I didn't post or respond to anything on github. I was just focused on my work and didn't have an quick questions for the community.
