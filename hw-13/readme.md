# Final Project Proposal

For my final project I was thinking about creating a carnival game. Specifically, a balloon popping game. Basically I would make a class that would create all the balloons and then create a class that would make the darts. The user would then click where he would want to throw the dart. The balloons would then pop if the dart hit them.

I also have some other things that I might add or replace. One thing being the dart. If I find that creating a dart to throw being too complicated (hopefully not), I might replace that with a slingshot. I also might add a score board on the side of the balloon board. And if I find myself wanting to do even more, I might add in a feature where depending on the score the user gets a prize and then the prize will be presented on screen. Also, adding an aspect of wind that would move the darts slightly would be interesting. Not sure how I would code that but just ideas that I might try to incorperate. Like I said, these are just some extra ideas that I might add if I have time. Otherwise, the carnival game as stated at the top will be my project.

I haven't encountered any specific artists or projects that will really help me. Just past examples of object interaction and classes will hopefully be enough help to get me by.

Some problems I know that I will face will be coding the interaction between the dart and balloon. I'm writing this proposal before I have finish hw-12 and so I haven't coded interaction yet. There's a bunch of "problems" I'm thinking about but most of them are just not being comfortable with coding in general. I think that the project I have in mind is do-able. It will just take me a long time and a lot of figuring out. I think the biggest problem for me is just time. Even though Michael has given me an extension to finish this project, I'm still racing the clock on when I need to finish it. And considering how I haven't started it yet and still need to finish hw-12, time will be the biggest problem/obstacle I will need to get through.

The plan is to finish hw-12 and get an idea on how to code interaction. Then to slowly put this project together. I'll be meeting with Michael during his office hrs on Monday and Thursday to get some general help, which I'm sure I'll need. Ideally, I should get this project done by the end of next weekend (4th and 5th). Seem's like a long time but I'm sure it will take me forever to figure everything out.
