# HW-3 Response
This week I got around to completing homework 3. Some of this I alreadly knew
from previous coding classes but I watched the videos just in case I forgot
something. Homework 3 was mainly about learning how to delcare certain functions
like setup and draw. I also learned how to create an epilpse, canvas and background.

I completed this assignment by following along in the videos and reading the directions.
I had to use the sketch.js file for practice examples. I also had to install a package
that allows me to open my code in web browsers.

No problems or issues. Just very behind and trying to catch up. Hopefully after
cathing up on my work, I can pass this class with a passing grade.
Nothing I'd like to discuss further. I did not help my classmates out
with this because I am turning this in late.
