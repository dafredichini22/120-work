# Hw-8

This week has been a bit disorderly. I was pretty much done with hw-8 besides one thing in my code which I didn't know how to make work, namely making the lights alternate colors. I went to Michael's office hrs and he helped me fix it. It's funny because the only thing he did was remove one peice of code (a while loop) and then my whole program worked! He exaplined how the whole loop was simply giving me the end result in my draw loop rather than compute the if statement as the timer goes up.

This assignment is going to be out of order. I just turned in hw-10 the other day and this will be turned in after it.

I did continue to use the github issues forum for help the the alternating color in my code but unfortunetly I couldn't fixed the problem with the suggestions I was given. Luckily Michael figured it out.

I also started hw-11 this week. I've made a lot of progress in it. Michael's office hrs also helped with it. Probably going to tweek some of the code he suggested but all in all, lots of progress made this week.
