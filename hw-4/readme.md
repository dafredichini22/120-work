# HW-4 Response
This week I went through the week 4 module and completed hw-4. Hw-4 was to use code to make a self portrait. I did this by using various functions such as rect(), ellipse(), arc(), rotate(), fill()... etc. And by loading up my code ever so often onto Google Chrome to see if my code did what I wanted it to do.

No problems or issues. Just getting around to the assignment as always is hard for me to do since I'm so behind. No felp from other classmates and no I did not help them out either since they've all finished this assignment for a while now.

The newest thing I learned what the arc() and rotate() function. I didn't know about those before.

Here is the link to my self portrait:
