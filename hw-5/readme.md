# Empty p5 sketch.
This week I went through the course content for week 5 and complete hw-5. Hw-5 was to essentially create a canvas that has a function that changes on its own and have a function in which the user can interact with it. I chose to create a backdrop that had raindrops falling down in a loop. Then I added an umbrella that the user could move around that would give an illusion that it is stopping the raindops from hitting the ground. I found that a lot of aspects of the hw that I wanted to create were too adavanced and required techniques of code that I was not familiar with and that we will go over in future assignments.

I also went to Micheal's office hrs to talk with him about some questions about the assignment to make sure I was doing it right as well as talk about how I may pass his class.

What I've learned from this experience is that sometimes you have to work with what tools you have to make your project work.

I'm still trying to catch up with work in this class but one by one I will get there.
